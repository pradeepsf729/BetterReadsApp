## BetterReads App hosts large number of book inventory which provides the ability for user to track the books reading status, search for any book, and list author details of any book. Inspired from [here](https://www.goodreads.com/) :)

#### The non functional requirements or the goals of this app from the application and learning perspective can be

* Performant
    * The book page, author pages should load very quickly
* Handle large amount of data
    * The app should handle enormous amount of book inventory data. ( no limits)
* Reliable
    * The app should be up and ruuning and should not crash or non-responsive.
* Backend focused (learning requirement , not the app specific)
    * The app will have very simple html based UI and the backend functionalities are more in focus.
